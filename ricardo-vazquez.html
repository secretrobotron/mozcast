          <p>Back in march, I sat down with Ricardo Vazquez to talk about his passion for practicing design in the open. Before our interview, I caught him noodling with a guitar while I did a sound-check and encouraged him to play more. With talent and grace characteristic of Ricardo, he switched into performance-mode, and gave us a great intro.</p>

          <h4 data-audio="87">The &quot;Burden of Design&quot;</h4>
          <p>Many teams within Mozilla rely on the creativity and skill of the design team Ricardo belongs to. For years, they've honed their craft, not just creating world-class designs, but intently listening to the people that require their expertise. However, Ricardo belongs to a school of thought that advocates for giving agency to content creators wherever possible, and their most recent endeavor is a Content Management System done within the modern, open, empathetic style of Mozilla's design team.</p>

          <div class="quote" data-audio="122">We can't always predict when new content can come out and the immediacy of that and the context in which it will be shared.</div>

          <p>Ricardo talks lovingly about not removing himself from the equation of design and content creation, but providing a space for anybody to be empowered by the thoughtful work of his team.</p>

          <div class="repeat-portrait" style="background-image: url('img/ricardo-vazquez/25218668030_c546dc27d2_o.png');"></div>
          <h4 data-audio="277">Designing in the Open</h4>
          <p>Ricardo takes openness to heart, and, inspired by other projects, tries to put himself in front of a community of designers&mdash;professional, aspiring, or otherwise.</p>

          <div class="quote" data-audio="281">The practice of design as a whole is shaded in secrecy.</div>

          <p>Because design is not able to be seen by everyone in its true collaborative nature, aspiring designers have scarce resources to learn and improve upon their craft. Ricardo has created a live stream YouTube series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okcBcDOkeLw">Hour of Design</a>. Through this medium, he has been able to share his passion and personality to the whole world.</p>

          <h4>Removing the Training Wheels</h4>
          <p>A beautiful aspect in design is to support the work behind meaningful intent. Towards the end of my conversation with Ricardo, we spoke about the moments that mark the shift from a novice designer into a more experienced and thoughtful maker.</p>
          
          <div class="quote">The important thing in the Hour of Design was to verbalize decisions and verbalize intentions.</div>
          
          <p>Ricardo mentions that the shift from Craft into Analysis can always be made by asking a simple question: “Why?” Ricardo walks us through the first time he stepped into, and stumbled, through this question. Answering the Why allowed him to be able to verbalize his intent, and move towards a selfless human-centred design approach.</p>
